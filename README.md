This project explores the impact of adding hidden layers to a basic neural network model for classifying the MNIST handwritten digits. 
It includes training a simple neural network and then enhancing it by adding a hidden layer to improve accuracy. 
The project shows how network depth affects classification performance, and confusion matrices are used for visual evaluation of model predictions.


**Content:**
Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset

**Models:**

Model 1: Single-layer dense network with sigmoid activation

Model 2: Two-layer dense network with ReLU and sigmoid activations

**Comparison:**
Training and test accuracy are compared for both models.
Confusion matrices are plotted to show prediction accuracy.

**Requirements:**
TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib
Seaborn
NumPy
